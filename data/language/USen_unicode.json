    "T_ExplainEnemy_46": "● Elimination\n　・ Take out the Salmonid operating the Big Shot launcher.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ Among muscle-bound Salmonids, those with belligerent\n　  personalities tend to be assigned as Steelheads, while those\n　  with calmer dispositions are assigned to Big Shots.\n　・ On Salmonid holidays, Big Shot workers like to launch special\n　  fireworks in place of cannonballs to make things more festive.",
