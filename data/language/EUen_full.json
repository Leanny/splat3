The once-stable orbit of the Polaris decayed over time until\nthe ship found itself in the inescapable pull of the Earth's gravity.\nReentry was not kind to its inhabitants\u2014all perished, save one. Bear #03,\nan experimental subject who had retained consciousness within his cold\nhibernation, survived. For 12,000 years he had dreamed. And plotted.",
    "AreaEx_Analyzed_L04": "Fully awakened, Bear #03 came to a terrible realization. He had not\nlanded on a new planet at all. He was back on Earth. And yet, it was\nnot an Earth he knew. This Earth, it seemed, was dominated by sea\ncreatures. Not a single mammal to be found.",
    "AreaEx_Analyzed_L05": "In the course of his search for even a single fellow mammal, Bear #03 used\nnavigational equipment from the wreckage of the Ark Polaris to discover\nAlterna. It was a wasteland, of course, but a few of the liquid crystals\nthat had once covered the walls and ceiling remained. With knowledge built\nduring his thousands of years of dreaming, he repaired some of Alterna's\nfacilities and began researching the crystals...",
    "AreaEx_Analyzed_L06": "This research bore fruit when Bear #03 compounded some of the liquid\ncrystals with his own fur. The experiment created an entirely new\nsubstance with one terrifying property\u2014it could transform any living\ncreature into a mammal. Bear #03 realized the implications immediately.\nHe could restore the planet to a mammalian paradise! He began stockpiling\nFuzzy Ooze, as he called it, within Alterna's still-intact rocket...",
    "AreaEx_Analyzed_L07": "For such a venture, he would require the acquisition of thousands of\nGolden Eggs. These were used in the creation of the Fuzzy Ooze, although\nthe exact details have never been recorded in my memory banks. But Bear #03\nhad a plan. He founded a corporation that would go on to employ locals\nto collect his Golden Eggs under the name Grizzco Industries. Mr. Grizz,\nas he was now known, would pay handsomely for them...",
    "AreaEx_Analyzed_L08": "With Fuzzy Ooze production peaking thanks to the assistance of\nunsuspecting Inklings and Octolings, Mr. Grizz took the final\nsteps to set his plan in motion. The rocket was loaded...\nIt wouldn't be long now.",
